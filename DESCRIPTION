Description: Provides deterministic forecasting for weekly, monthly,
    quarterly, and yearly time series using the Generalized Adaptive Capped
    Estimator. The method includes preprocessing steps for handling missing
    and extreme values, extraction of multiple growth components (including
    long-term, short-term, rolling, and drift-based signals), volatility-aware
    asymmetric capping, optional seasonal adjustment through damped and
    normalized seasonal factors, and a recursive forecast formulation with
    moderated growth. The main interface 'gace_forecast()' returns forecasts
    in a consistent structure, and 'plot_gace()' offers visualization support.
