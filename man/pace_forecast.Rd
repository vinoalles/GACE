}
\value{

\description{

that blends Year-over-Year, Quarter-over-Quarter, and Prior-Quarter growth rates,
applies volatility capping, and generates forward projections suitable for
business, economic, and operational forecasting.

\examples{
df <- data.frame(Time = seq(as.Date("2020-01-01"), by="quarter", length.out=12),
                 Value = rnorm(12, 100, 10))
pace_forecast(df, periods = 4)
